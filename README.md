# RfgTools++
Code for interacting the file formats of the PC versions of Red Faction Guerrilla. This is actively used by [Nanoforge](https://github.com/Moneyl/Nanoforge/). Special thanks to [Gibbed](https://github.com/gibbed/) who originally reverse engineered the packfile, texture, vint_doc, and asm_pc formats.

## Formats
The table below lists each format used by RFG and how much this library supports them. Extensions prepended with an asterisk `*` are stored by the game as two files known as the cpu file and gpu file. For example, for static meshes `.csmesh_pc` is the cpu file extension and `.gsmesh_pc` is the gpu file extension.
